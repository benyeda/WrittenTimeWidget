Welcome to the project.

This is an android home screen widget written in Java. I used some tutorials and other GitHub projects for creting its skeleton (https://github.com/rakeshcusat/Code4Reference/blob/master/AndroidProjects/WidgetAlarmManagerExample,
https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/building-a-customizable-android-analog-clock-widget--mobile-11685 ).
The only thing it does that is shows the current time in words but in Hungarian. The same exists for English but we talked about implementing it for Hungarian.
Mostly for practice. So this is the result. There are some things to be done like creating a fancier layout and so on...
