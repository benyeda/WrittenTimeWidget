Welcome to the project.

This is an android home screen widget written in Java. I used some tutorials and other GitHub projects for creating its skeleton (https://github.com/rakeshcusat/Code4Reference/blob/master/AndroidProjects/WidgetAlarmManagerExample,
https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/building-a-customizable-android-analog-clock-widget--mobile-11685 ).

It is a very simple widget. The only thing it does that is shows the current time in words (in Hungarian). The same exists for English but it seemed a good idea to implement it using Hungarian.
So this is the result. There are some things to be done like creating a fancier layout and so on...
